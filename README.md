Streamlit Application: Book Recommender System
This Streamlit application recommends books based on the genre entered by the user. It utilizes the Open Library API to fetch books in the specified genre, summarizes their descriptions using the Transformers library, and visualizes the connections between books using NetworkX and Matplotlib.

Features
Genre-based Book Recommendation: Users can input a genre (e.g., "science fiction") and receive recommendations for top books in that genre.

Automatic Summarization: The application uses the Transformers library to summarize the descriptions of the top books and helps identify the best book based on these summaries.

Graph Visualization: NetworkX and Matplotlib are employed to create visual graphs that show relationships between recommended books, enhancing understanding and exploration.
